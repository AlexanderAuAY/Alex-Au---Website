How can art help guide you through learning about programming and computer science?
Generally, people don't really think that these 2 fields have anything to do with each other. One is a fine art, revered across the world,
while the other is a hobby for people who don't go outside. Generally public perception of technology is even worse too. Violent video games 
cause violent behaviour, and technology is stealing away the populace's ability to hold a conversation or to read a book.

Personally, I think that software and art are very intertwined. Both are an artform where a person can express themeselves with their depth and creativity.
Both have a general process that can be followed or ignored but that's ultimately a tool to help you along. For example, you could draw
a picture with markers and paper, but only if you're good enough can you turn it into art. With coding, you could use an if statement for
it's general purpose, or add things around it like a loop to make it more complex and useful. Generally, I consider both fundamentally 
as an art form for free expression, despite their widely seen differences.
