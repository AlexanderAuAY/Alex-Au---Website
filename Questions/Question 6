Summarize your experience with khan academy.

Generally Khan Academy was a very well made and helpful website. It has a very clean and easy to follow UI and 
it teaches effectively and efficiently in a variety of subjects. The videos and short hint codes help you get a start so
that you won't be lost when you try to complete their challenges and products. The avatars are a nice little reward for
working a lot and the badges help give a sense of accomplishment.

In my personal experience, I found that the only thing that Khan Academy lacked was user help. The comment section can only help so much, 
and without a teacher I found that when I made mistakes I was hard to find the root cause. The evaluation system was also deeply flawed as it took a
ages to mark anything and when they were and you resubmitted it took even longer again. Beyond that I generally had no other problems with Khan 
Academy.
