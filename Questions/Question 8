How does version control(github) allow you to learn more about coding principles?

Github teaches the extremely important factor of preplanning and being able to reflect on what you've done. An especially important
skill especially in software development where multiple builds of an app/game/software will be made to reflect a new direction
or for general bug fixes. In terms of individual development, version control allows you to look back and see what you've done to 
see what mistakes you've made. Being able to look at where you've gone wrong will help to learn about your mistakes and shortcomings 
to accomodate in the future.

In my personal opinion, version control is a great tool since I tend to make a lot of mistakes when I code. Whether it be a mistyped line or
extra semi colon, I always seem to mess something up. That's why I enjoy having the ability to go back and look at what I've done and 
think about whether or not I've made any fundamental mistakes with my code. As well, I can revert if I've decided that my project needs to 
take a new direction.
